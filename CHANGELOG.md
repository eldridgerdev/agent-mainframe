## [Unreleased]

_No unreleased changes yet._

## [v0.9.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- On-demand tree-sitter parser management — a language picker lets you
  install and select syntax highlighting grammars at runtime without
  restarting, accessible from the diff viewer and diff review prompt.
- Scroll support in the diff review prompt pane (j/k, g/G, mouse wheel).
- Opencode change-tracker plugin (`.opencode/plugins/change-tracker.js`)
  that watches file writes, emits AMF notifications, and wires into the
  diff review approval flow for Opencode sessions.

### Fixed

- Diff review flow for Opencode sessions now correctly triggers the
  change-reason prompt and handles accept/reject signalling.
- Diff review patch scroll state is now shared consistently between the
  diff viewer and diff review prompt.

### Migration

- No store migration is required.
- To use Opencode diff review, the
  `.opencode/plugins/change-tracker.js` plugin must be present in your
  repo (included automatically for new features).

## [v0.8.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- Built-in in-app diff viewer for view mode with a file list, patch pane,
  unified and side-by-side layouts, refresh support, and keyboard
  navigation.
- Tree-sitter syntax highlighting for the diff viewer, plus contextual
  line highlighting and clearer diff gutters.
- In-app markdown file picker and viewer for `.claude/*.md` files and
  top-level `*.md` files while viewing a feature.
- Repo-root markdown discovery for worktree features, so shared files
  like `PLAN.md` can be opened without leaving the current session.
- Vibeless-mode Codex diff review automation that watches file writes,
  opens the change-reason prompt, and reverts rejected changes.

### Changed

- Diff review and markdown-reading workflows now stay inside AMF instead
  of requiring an external tool or a separate terminal flow.
- Markdown picker labels now distinguish worktree files from repo-root
  files when both scopes are available.

### Migration

- No store migration is required.
- If you use Codex vibeless-mode diff review, install `inotifywait`
  (usually provided by `inotify-tools`) so the watcher can run.

## [v0.7.0] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- Full automation system for creating projects, features, and batch features via CLI and IPC
  - `amf automation create-project` for programmatic project creation

- Steering Coach startup prompt overlay for coaching new features
- Plan mode for collaborative planning sessions with shared PLAN.md

  `nord`, and Catppuccin variants.

  better responsiveness.

### Migration

  global config and merged on top of it.
- Existing saved state is auto-migrated to include summary and
  nickname fields.
