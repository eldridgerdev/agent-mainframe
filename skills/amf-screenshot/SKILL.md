  Capture screenshots (PNG) or a GIF of AMF's own TUI running in an
  isolated, throwaway instance, as visual proof a feature/UI change
  works. Use only when the user explicitly asks for visual proof
  ("show me a screenshot of X", "prove the dashboard renders Y") —
  not automatically after every UI change.

## When to use

Only when the user explicitly asks for visual proof that an AMF
feature or UI change works. Do not run this unprompted after routine
UI edits — it's for on-demand review, not a build step.

## Isolation guarantees

`scripts/dev/screenshot/amf-capture.sh` launches a **throwaway
scratch AMF instance**, never the user's real one:

- Its own `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` / `XDG_STATE_HOME` under
  `${AMF_SHOT_DIR:-/tmp/amf-shots}/<timestamp>/` — the real
  `~/.config/amf/amf.db` and any real running `amf` session are never
  touched.
- A dedicated tmux session (`amf-shot-<timestamp>`), separate from any
  `amf-*` session the user already has.
- Fixed geometry, `120x40` by default (`--geometry WxH` to override) —
  reproducible pane layout across runs.
- Teardown kills the scratch tmux session and deletes the scratch root
  on exit; pass `--keep` to preserve it for debugging.

## Step 1: author a scenario for the feature you just built

Look at what you actually changed, then write a scenario file using
the driver's grammar — don't reuse a generic scenario blindly. Read
`scripts/dev/screenshot/scenarios/dashboard-tour.txt` and
`create-project-flow.txt` for the grammar in practice before writing
one.

Grammar (one step per line, `|`-separated, blank lines and `#`
comments ignored):

- `key:<name>` — `tmux send-keys` key name (`key:Enter`, `key:j`,
  `key:Escape`, `key:?`)
- `text:<literal>` — literal typed text (`text:my-feature-name`)
- `wait:<ms>` — sleep, use after keys that trigger a redraw or async
  work (harness checks, status sync)
- `shot:<label>` — capture the pane now, written as
  `NNN-<label>.ansi`

Put a `shot:` at every point worth showing (before the change, mid
interaction, after the change lands) rather than just first/last.
Author the file under `scripts/dev/screenshot/scenarios/` if it's
worth keeping as a reusable example, otherwise a scratch path (e.g.
your scratchpad dir) is fine for a one-off.

## Step 2: run the driver

```bash
scripts/dev/screenshot/amf-capture.sh --scenario <your-scenario> --out-dir <dir>
```

Relevant flags:

- `--seed <automation-json>` — pre-populate demo state (a project
  and/or feature) via the automation IPC before the scenario runs, if
  the feature you're proving needs existing projects/features to be
  visible. See `scripts/dev/screenshot/scenarios/seed-project.json`
  and `seed-feature.json` for the payload shape (`docs/automation/`
  has the full schema); action is inferred from the payload's keys
  (`path` → create-project, `branch` → create-feature).
- `--gif` — only pass this if the user asked for a GIF/video, not for
  a plain "show me a screenshot" request. Screenshots (PNG) are the
  default deliverable.
- `--keep` — preserve the scratch root instead of deleting it on exit
  (useful while iterating on a scenario).

This produces, per `shot:` step, a numbered `.ansi` dump and a
plain-text `.txt` twin (same capture, no escape codes) in `--out-dir`
(default `<scratch-root>/shots`).

## Step 3: render PNGs

**`amf-capture.sh` does not render PNGs unless `--gif` is passed** —
without `--gif` you get raw `.ansi` dumps only, and must render each
one yourself:

```bash
python3 scripts/dev/screenshot/render_ansi.py <dump>.ansi --out <dump>.png --cols 120 --rows 40
```

Pass `--cols`/`--rows` matching the `--geometry` used for the capture
(120x40 by default) so every frame renders at the same size. Repeat
per `.ansi` file. If `--gif` was passed instead, the driver already
renders and assembles the GIF — nothing further to do.

## Step 4: verify cheaply, then return the result

Verify content against the `.txt` twins, not the images: grep each
one for the strings the frame should show (a dialog title, the typed
text, a status line). The `.txt` files are small and escape-free —
never read the `.ansi` files, whose escape codes waste tokens.

Only after the text checks pass, Read **one or two representative
PNGs** as images to confirm layout/colors look right — not every
frame. Then return the absolute file paths of all PNGs (or the GIF)
as the deliverable proof — that's the artifact the user is asking
for, not a description of what should be visible.
