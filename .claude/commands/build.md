Run `cargo build` in the project root and report any errors.
If there are compilation errors, analyze the error messages
and fix the issues. After fixing, run `cargo build` again
to verify the fix compiles cleanly.

Do NOT run `cargo build` if you haven't made any changes
since the last successful build.
